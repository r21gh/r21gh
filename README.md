Hello, my name is Reza Ghanbari, and I am a DevOps Engineer and also pursuing a Ph.D. in Computer Security at Delft University of Technology. My research focus is on eBPF, with a specific emphasis on eBPF security and vulnerabilities.

In addition to my academic pursuits, I have extensive experience as a DevOps engineer. My skill set covers many technologies, including Docker and Kubernetes for containerization and orchestration. I am proficient in programming languages such as Golang, Python, and Rust, which enables me to build efficient tools and scripts.

I am also experienced in system monitoring, using tools like Prometheus and Grafana to monitor performance. I am comfortable working with cloud platforms like AWS and GCP, enabling me to deploy applications in the cloud seamlessly. I am skilled in setting up CI/CD pipelines to automate software releases efficiently while prioritizing security best practices and threat mitigation.

Networking is another area of strength for me, ensuring secure and effective communication among applications. Additionally, I am well-versed in DNS, a critical network management component. I dabble in Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with tools like Terraform and CloudFormation, making infrastructure provisioning a breeze.

I am keenly interested in cybersecurity startups in my downtime and enjoy reading business-related books to stay informed and inspired in the ever-evolving tech industry.
